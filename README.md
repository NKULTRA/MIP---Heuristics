# MIP---Heuristics
Master thesis - implement various MIP Heuristics, mostly non root from the LP-Relaxation

- simple round
- zi round
- feasibility pump
- shift and propagate
- pseudocost diving

some of them were implemented just to solve BIPs, because this was the task

model.py is the Model Class and is necessary in all of them

gurobi and numpy are necessary, model files were read in mps format
